## How our work is different

Scientific software is different. You can't just make it by requirements because creating requirements is a major part of the job.

We work together with a customer in a tight collaboration to better understand the problem and provide the best way to solve it. We do research. Our team consist not of programmers, but of scientists so when deep understanding is important, it is our work. 

On the other hand, our team have a lot of expertise in industrial programming, so we do not do only research code in notebooks, we provide **MVP** or **product** grade development.

## Our limitations

Our work is focused on research software. We do not have facilities to provide full-scale industrial development and deployment. But we have qualification and desire to work with technical specialists inside companies to integrate our research expertise with company industrial capabilities.
